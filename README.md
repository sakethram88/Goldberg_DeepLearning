<h1>Goldberg Variation 31</h1>
<br>
<h4><em>Goldberg Variations</em> is a set of 30 variations based on an original aria written for the keyboard by Johann Sebastian Bach in the year 1741.<br>
  In this repository, I have created a 31st Goldberg variation using Recurrent Neural Networks.<br>
  Three different datasets have been used to create three different variations to Bach's aria.
<br>
  MelodyRNN has been used to produce output sequences. The datasets are in MIDI format.<br>
  The code used has been provided [here](https://github.com/sakethram88/Goldberg_DeepLearning/blob/master/Goldberg_DeepLearning.ipynb)
