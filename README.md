<h1>Goldberg Variation 31</h1>
<br>
<p><em>Goldberg Variations (BWV 988)</em> is a set of 30 variations based on an original aria written for the keyboard by Johann Sebastian Bach in the year 1741.<br>
  In this repository, I have created a 31st Goldberg variation using Recurrent Neural Networks.<br>
  Three different datasets have been used to create three different variations to Bach's aria.
<br>
  MelodyRNN has been used to produce output sequences. The datasets are in MIDI format.<br>

  <h2>About The Code</h2>
  <p>The code used has been provided in this file <a href="https://github.com/sakethram88/Goldberg_DeepLearning/blob/master/Goldberg_DeepLearning.ipynb">Goldberg_DeepLearning.ipynb</a><br>
  <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/"> Magenta </a> is an open source python library which can be used to generate music and art using machine learning.
  <br>MelodyRNN can be used to generate melodies. It is an LSTM based neural network.
  <br>
  MelodyRNN works on Note Sequences but our datasets are in MIDI format, so some functions have been used to facilitate interconversion between them.
